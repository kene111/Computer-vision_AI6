# Computer-vision_AI6
These are the projects/works I did in computer vision during the 4th AI saturday cohort.

## LLColorizer, Cartoonize, Filters:
These are works done to get familiar with the cv2 library, and have idea on pixel manipulation, filters, edge detection etc. 

## Skin Detection:
This was done in order to get familiar with skin pixels in images.

## Neural Style Transfer:
This project was done to understand how to work with convolutional neural netorks, the layers, and how to make use of the features the layers learn.
