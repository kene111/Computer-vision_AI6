## Computer-vision_AI6
These are the projects/works I did in computer vision during the 4th AI saturday cohort.

# LLColorizer, Cartoonize, Filters:
These are works done to get familiar with the cv2 library, and have idea on pixel manipulation, filters, edge detection etc. test_image.jpeg is used in LLColorizer and test.JPG is used in Cartoonize.

# Neural Style Transfer:
This project was done to understand how to work with convolutional neural netorks, the layers, and how to make use of the features the layers learn. Images used are nike.jpg and skyling.jpg

References used or if used are indicated at the end of each notebook.
